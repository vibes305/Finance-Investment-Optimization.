    "# Optimisation using Linear program \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Investor has £20,000 to invest in following:\n",
    "\n",
    "i) Stock XYZ sells today at £20/share.\n",
    "ii)Call option to buy 100 shares of stock XYZ at £15/share after 6 months from today sells for £1,000.\n",
    "iii)Can sell “Call-option” to raise funds, with above rules.\n",
    "iv)6-month bond with £100 face value sells for £90.\n",
    "Limit the no of call options to buy or sell to at most 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider 3 output Scenario prediction for Stock XYZ in 6 months.\n",
    "i) Price will be “£20” as today.\n",
    "ii)Price will go up to “£40”.\n",
    "iii) Price will drop at “£12”.\n",
    "Each scenario is equally likely to happen. Hence probability is 1/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem statement 1:\n",
    "#### Aim to formulate and solve linear program to find portfolio of stocks, bonds, and options that maximises profit.\n",
    "Let’s assume decision variable, which helps to decide the maximum profit.\n",
    "S is number of stocks XYZ purchased.\n",
    "B is number of bonds purchased.\n",
    "C1 is number of call-options purchased.\n",
    "C2 is number of call-options sold.\n",
    "Let’s find maximum profit from each of investment options.\n",
    "#### i) Bonds: £10/bond\n",
    "#### ii)Stock: Has three scenarios, \n",
    "1.\tStock sells at £20, profit is 0\n",
    "2.\tStock sells at £40, profit is 20\n",
    "3.\tStock sells at £12, profit is -8\n",
    "So, 1/3(0) + 1/3(20) + 1/3(-8) = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iii)Call-options purchased: Has three scenarios,\n",
    "1.\tBuy stock for £15, then sell it at £20. So, profit is £5. Subtract this with premium amount paid/stock £10. So final profit will be -£5.\n",
    "2.\tBuy stock for £15, then sell it at £40. So, profit is £25. Subtract this with premium amount paid/stock £10. So final profit will be £15.\n",
    "3.\tBuy stock for £15, then sell it at £12. So, profit is -£3. As profit is in negative, no need to sell it. Hence loss is premium amount paid/stock. Which is £10.\n",
    "So, 1/3(-5) + 1/3(15) + 1/3(-10) = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iv)Call-options sold: Has three scenarios,\n",
    "1.\tBuy stock for £20, then sell it at £15. So, loss is £5. Subtract this with premium amount paid/stock £10. So final profit will be £5.\n",
    "2.\tBuy stock for £40, then sell it at £15. So, profit is -£25. Subtract this with premium amount paid/stock £10. So final profit will be -£15.\n",
    "3.\tBuy stock for £12, then sell it at £15. So, profit is -£3. As profit is in negative, no need to sell it. Hence loss is premium amount paid/stock. Which is £10.\n",
    "So, 1/3(5) + 1/3(-15) + 1/3(10) = 0\n",
    "As Call-option purchased values are exactly inverse of Call-options sold. Both profits are zeros.\n",
    "So, we get a linear expression as 10B+4S\n",
    "Now let’s find constraint of our Budget:\n",
    "As Bonds sell for £90 = 90B\n",
    "As stock sell for £20 = 20S\n",
    "As call-options purchased for and sold for £20 = 1000C1 /1000C2\n",
    "So, equation is 90B+20S+1000C1 <=20,000 + 1000C2\n",
    "Limitation constraints given:\n",
    "Limit call options buy or sell to at most 50\n",
    "C1<=50 and C2<=50\n",
    "Let’s find Implicit constraints:\n",
    "0<=S, 0<=B, 0<=C1, 0<=C2\n",
    "So final equation to maximize is 10B + 4S \n",
    "Subject to: 90B + 20S + 10(C1-C2) <=20,000\n",
    "0<=S, 0<=B, 0<=C1, 0<=C2\n",
    "C1<=50 and C2<=50\n",
    "\n",
    "Here variables C1 and C2 can be simplified. Where C = C1 - C2 and when value of C is negative it is selling call options and when it is positive it is buying option.\n",
    "Hence the new LP is shown below\n",
    "Using Linear programming to find the maximum profit\n",
    "#### So final equation to maximize is 10B + 4S \n",
    "#### Subject to: 90B + 20S + 1000C <=20,000\n",
